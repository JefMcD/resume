    <h2>What I did during Lockdown</h2> 
    <h3>2020 - 2022</h3>
    <div>
        In January 2020 I began with an anoying chest infection that had been hanging around since catching some weird lurgy from one of the traders at Christmas, so I was taking it easy for a bit. I was doing the best work I had ever done and I had commissions that would last until the Spring. I was organising a whole bunch of art fairs and comic cons across the country, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Newcastle, so it was shaping up to be a busy year. In February I did a Film Festival and sold a ton of work so I was feeling positive about the year ahead. People were talking about the latest virus to come down the pipe but nobody was scared,  everybody regarded it as just another bug going around. As you know, things were about to change spectacularly overnight.

        In March, A couple of weeks later the country was under a new type of Govt Regime. Lockdown. A term previously only used in Prisons. The BBC and Media was broadcasting 24/7 terror and fear-porn about Covid and my overwhelming feeling was of puzzlement and confusion because none of it made any sense. I felt like we were on the receiving end of a very hard sell. Shortly after we were told that the restrictions and lockdowns were only for two weeks to flatten the curve. So I read Neil Fergusons Imperial College report which was used to justify the worldwide lockdowns and restrictions. He stated that Covid had a 3-5% mortality and there would be an additional 500,000 dead in the UK and an additional 2 Million dead in the USA by the end of the year. Shocking. In the paper, He also demanded that Lockdowns and restrictions be kept in place until a vaccine was availble. Soon after, his financial backer Bill Gates turned up on TV (fresh back from Event201, where he wargamed a Coronavirus palndemic in NOv 2019), predicting that lockdowns would last 2 years and would only end when the worlds population was largely vaccinated. Bill Gates the modern day Nostradamus.

        The mathematical model Fergusson bodged together to arrive at these terrifying numbers was quickly trashed by mathemeticians such as Nobel laureat Dr Michael Levitt who calculated that Ferguson was off by ten orders of magnitude, and scores of programmers who slaughtered his refusal to release the code for peer review. But it made no difference and they carried on like zombies.

        This and the evidence of my own eyes was just the beginning of my skepticism of the Lockdowns and restrictions, and as time went on, and the absurd rules, masks and propaganda became more bizarre and nonsensical, I became more and more opposed to them; not to mention the media's fanaticism for lockdowns, dehumanising masks and for persecuting anyone who questioned their junk science. The corporate media's fear-porn was nothing short of foaming-at-the-mouth rabid hysteria. I spent the next two years engaging in peaceful non-compliance and reading and watching everything I could about Covid from Doctors and Scientists who were fighting back, and posting it on social media to anybody who would listen. I spent all day arguing with lunatics on twitter and Facebook who were demanding more restrictions and harsher lockdowns (it emerged that hundreds of thousands of these accounts were were bots originating in China and UK Govt funded). But the brainwashing and Groupthink was real. I think watching friends, family and people in the West enthusiatically embrace Tyranny and Fascism Is probably the most disturbing thing Ive ever witnessed. To keep my sanity I went to anti-lockdown protests and met thousands more like me and I made comix to help keep my spirits up and keep me busy. I didn't comply with any of the restrictions and have declined all of the injections, and for that, I thank God.

        In the end Covid has a mortality of 0.1% similar to Flu and the median age of death 'with' it is higher than life expectancy. Mortality in 2020 was also within normal limits and Flu Vanished from the face of the Earth. It wasnt Public Health it was an attempt to destroy freedom and democracy, and terrorise people into surrendering to a biomedical surveillance state.
